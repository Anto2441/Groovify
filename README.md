# 🎵 Playlist Generator SaaS

A learning-oriented SaaS project focused on building a modern fullstack React application.

The goal of this project is to design and implement a **music playlist generator** based on user-defined filters such as:
- year range
- music genre
- number of tracks

This project is **not a Spotify clone** and does not aim to stream music.
It focuses on **playlist discovery, data fetching, and application architecture**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project is built primarily to:

- deepen understanding of modern React fullstack architecture
- learn and practice TanStack Start (routing, loaders, server functions)
- work with real-world third-party APIs (Spotify Web API)
- apply clean code and scalable architecture principles
- improve testing practices (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- follow realistic professional development workflows

The emphasis is on **code quality, clarity, and maintainability**, not on feature quantity.

## 🧠 Development Philosophy

This project follows real-world engineering principles:

- incremental development
- small and meaningful commits
- separation of concerns
- testable business logic
- minimal over-engineering
- clear and readable code

Each feature is built progressively, starting with business logic before UI.

## 🚧 Project Status

**Early development stage**

Initial setup and tooling configuration in progress.

Core features will be implemented incrementally, starting with:
- Spotify API integration
- playlist generation logic
- automated tests
- authenticated user flows

## 📌 Notes

This repository is intended as a **technical showcase** and a **learning project**.

The focus is not on UI polish at the early stages, but on:
- correctness
- architecture
- developer experience
- long-term maintainability
